## Coding Round Experience
- 3 Problem of 50, 75 and 100 points, i think cutoff was 125, but not sure
- 50 point problem was like a typical codeforces binary search problem
- 75 point problem was just edit distance problem
- 100 point one was a bit tricky dynaminc programming but code was very small
- If you give cf contest regularly question will look familiar and easy

## Technical Round 1 Experience
- Duration : 60 min
- Number of interviewers : 1
- Mode : Google Meet + google docs for writing
- There was no formal intro or something like that. Interviewer directly jumped to Questions.
- Q1. What is Heap? How is it implemented? I explained him by drawing a binary tree and doing dry runs wasn't asked to implement it (5 min)
- Q2. Find the largest j such that A[j]>A[i] for i? O(n) is easy and popular example of stack, had to code on google docs. (5 min)
- Q3. What is Hashing and how many hashing algos do you know? I was asked to explain everything in great detail. I explained 3-4 hashing algos and he kept saying do you know any more. Then after 7-8 hashing algos while discussing extendible hashing he asked how will you optimally choose bucket size and we had 5-10 min discussion on that. (45 min)
- Q4. If i ask you to implement B+trees now will you be able to implement it? I said yes :) he didnt ask me to implement it though.
- Then he asked whether i have any question for him. I asked what exactly does product engineers do and which type of projects will be offered if selected.

## Technical Round 2 Experience
- Duration : 60 min
- Number of interviewers : 1
- Mode : Google Meet + Google docs for writing
- No intro, directly questions
- Q1. Explain any one of your projects. (15 min)
- Q2. (System Design) Design a chat application? write chat, message, friends etc classes and how these classes will be related. I went completely blank and told him that i have no idea how to approach something like this and asked if possible to ask another question.
- Q3. DSA question find the only index where A[1]< A[2] ... < A[i]< A[i+1] > A[i+2] ... > A[n]. O(logn) soln + code on google docs (5 min)
- Q4 - Q7 he asked some leetcode easy - medium graph problem to almost all of which i said have seen the problem and explained basic soln (10 min)
- Q8. https://leetcode.com/problems/wildcard-matching/ I said i have already done this and he then only asked base DP conditions (5 min)
- Q9. I asked can i try the system design again. He said yes and then wrote some classes and all he told me why my code was not optimal and suggested optimisations. He pointed out that my main goal was to optimise time / memory complexity but while designing you only think about how to make things abstract. I think i performed really bad in this part but it was more like he was teaching and not like i was solving it. (30 min)
- Then he asked whether i have any question for him. I asked him how exactly would he store a binary tree in a database. While discussing my project he said my way of doing it was really bad thats why i asked. 

## Hr Experience
- Duration : 30 min
- Still no intro :|
- Most of the time interviewer was speaking
- Q1. How will explain what sprinklr does in layman's terms
- Q2. Which is you dream company, you cannot say sprinklr? I preferred saying nothing and was silent for 2 min :)
- Q3. Two thing your friends love about you and two which they hate about you.
- Q4. Will you prefer remote or gurugram

## Company specific Tips/Some resources
- Don't write fake projects if you haven't made any leave empty but don't write fake projects, codealong etc is ok
- For sprinklr only :- If you dont know anything just say it and say it quickly
- Don't skip system design not only for sprinklr but many other companies
